Projects 1 and 2

The DrivePass project was to implement a system design for your client. The client wanted the system to focus helping their customers pass their driving tests and use tools based on the DMV guidelines. That client is DrivePass. They wanted to provide students with practice exams and on the road training with provided instructors and cars. They also wanted to implement a system where the students can buy driving packages, take online exams, and schedule and modify/cancel appointments. 

I think I understood LucidChart pretty well for the most part. It took some getting used to but it was a good tool to use to learn how clients want their system to operate. You learne how to incorporate what the needs of the client were into graphs that help map out the system they want to implement. 

Based on the interview transcript you can see what the goals of DrivePass are through their own persepective. This can be helpful to the design team and lets them create something based on the needs of the client because and the team has to be able to figure out who this system is for and interperet what the client wants as the end goal. 

I tried to keep everything as organized as possible. This included a step by step process such as having steps for logging in to the system, purchasing packages, and being able to modify and troubleshoot certain features. This included assigning certain functions to the users, staff, and aministration. Each week I was able to build on certain functions to help make the system manageable for the client in the end.
